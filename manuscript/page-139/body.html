You should say the first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love. A grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes of a country. Don't be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for you. This is merely the beginning."</p><p>"Do you think my nature so shallow?" cried Dorian Gray angrily.</p><p>"No; I think your nature so deep."</p></div> </div>
