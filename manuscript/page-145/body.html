<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination. They are limited to their century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?"</p><p>"Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian."</p><p>"Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces."</p></div> </div>
