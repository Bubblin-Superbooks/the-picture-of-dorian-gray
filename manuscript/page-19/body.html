Is that his name?" asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward.</p><p>"Yes, that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you."</p><p>"But why not?"</p><p>"Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?"</p></div> </div>
