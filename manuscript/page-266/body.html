Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife."</p><p>"Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this morning, and sent the note down by my own man."</p><p>"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like. You cut life to pieces with your epigrams."</p></div> </div>
