Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died. But don't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real than they are."</p><p>There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden.
