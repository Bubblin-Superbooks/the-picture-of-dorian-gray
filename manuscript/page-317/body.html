I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant."</p><p>"Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured Hallward regretfully. "And now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once again. But that can't be helped. I quite understand what you feel about it."</p></div> </div>
