I believe, according to the peerage, it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity, with time thrown in.

"A great many people don't, but I find him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type."</p><p>"I don't know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to Monte Carlo with his father."</p></div> </div>
